<p style="color:white;">What can you do to help the rainforests and wildlife?
<p style="color:white;">Even though animals and their environments are dying, there is still a lot that we can do to help.  The rain forest is getting torn down for paper and farming land and that is very unfortunate but what we
  can do is save paper. One sheet may not save the environment but if everybody contributed, the animals and forests would be saved. The more paper we use, the more trees are cut down to make more. Paper is not just used for 
  writing with. In fact, trees aren't only used for paper. The tools we use trees for are pencils, wood, cardboard boxes, juice boxes, wrappers, folders and thousands of other tools. Once these products are made, it can't be 
  undone. when you go to the supermarket, think to yourself,"Is this recyclable?" if yes, you can buy it while thinking to yourself,"Wow, when I am finished using this, it can be reused to make another object!" But if you say no,
  you can still buy it, but it can't be reused, causing more trees to be cut down to make another one. This is hurting the trees, plants and, even worse, killing the animals who live there. Unfortunately, Lots of people don't think
  or care about wildlife. Saving animals might not be their passion but you should care even if you don't want to volunteer to help. Some of the simplest and most effective ways of helping wildlife are:</p>
<ul style="color:white;">
<li>Donating to an animal conservation charity</li>
<li>Using reusable/recyclable items</li>
<li>planting trees</li>
<li>Use less paper</li>
<li>Buy items that donate to animal conservation charities</li>
<li>Make your own website to spread the message to even more people!</li>
</ul>
 <p style="color:white;"> Why do it tomorrow rather than today? Here are some useful sites you can donate to and save the lives of thousands of animals:</p>
