<head>What can you do to help?</head>
<p>Even though animals and their environments are dying, there is still a lot that we can do to help.  The rain forest is getting torn down for paper and farming land and that is very unfortunate but what we can do is save paper.
  One sheet may not save the environment but if everybody contributed, the animals and forests would be saved. The more paper we use, the more trees are cut down to make more. Paper is not just used for writing with. In fact,
  trees aren't only used for paper. the tools we use trees for are pencils, wood, cardboard boxes, juice boxes, wrappers, folders and thousands of other tools.</p>
