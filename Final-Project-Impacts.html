	<h3> Habitat Loss </h3>

		<p> Habitat loss has been a problem for hundreds of years, but the amount of habitat loss shot up during the industrial revolution. Ever since, the amount has been rising in correlation with the number of extinction.</p>
		<ol type="1">
		<p1> Other reasons for habitat loss include:
			<li> Agricultural Industry <li>
			<li> Human Homes <li>
			<li> Filling wetlands for stable land <li>
		</p1>
		
	<h3> Illegal Wildlife Trade </h3>
		
		<p> Despite the many laws put into place to protect animals from extinction, people still continue to hunt and trade animals illegally for their parts. Currently the most poached animal is the Rhino, specifically the Rhinos in the Kruger National Park. 
			In South Africa, more resources and money has been put into protection of the endangered animal and as of 2016, the number of poached Rhinos have decreased by a bit. </p>
